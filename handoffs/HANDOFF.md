# ICE — Nomba Hackathon: Session Handoff

> **User/Owner:** Peter Ajimoti (Team Lead)
> **Focus:** P01-P10 (Auth, Entities, API Gateway, Deploy)

> **Important Note on Handoffs:** All handoff logs live in the `handoffs/` directory to prevent merge conflicts.
> This `HANDOFF.md` serves as the primary log and Peter's personal log. Marvelous, Emmanuel, and Samkiel should use their respective `HANDOFF_<NAME>.md` files in this same directory.

## What Was Done

### 1. PRD Analysis & Task Breakdown

Peter shared a 14-section PRD for **ICE (Infrastructure for Collections & Exchange)** — a middleware layer on Nomba's DVA APIs for the Nomba Hackathon 2026. The full PRD covers:
- Two-tier merchant model (Platform Owner → Vendor → Customer)
- Inbound payment reconciliation (5 scenarios: exact, over, under, duplicate, misdirected)
- Webhook reliability with exponential backoff + dead-letter handling
- Auto-refund engine via Nomba Transfer API
- Payment anomaly detection + dormant account management
- Statement & reporting APIs
- Next.js + Tailwind CSS dashboard

### 2. Team Structure Established

| Dev | Name | Role | Task Series | Focus |
|-----|------|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **Peter** | Team Lead | P01–P10 (ICE-29 to ICE-38) | Scaffold, Auth, Merchants, Vendors, Customers, Deployment |
| 2 | **Marvelous** | Backend | M01–M08 (ICE-39 to ICE-46) | DB Schema, Webhooks, Invoices, Reconciliation, Misdirected |
| 3 | **Emmanuel** | Backend | E01–E09 (ICE-47 to ICE-54, ICE-309) | Redis, BullMQ, Webhook Delivery, Refunds, Statements, Cron |
| 4 | **Samkiel** | Frontend | S01–S10 (ICE-55 to ICE-64) | Next.js Dashboard — all UI pages and components |

### 3. Linear Workspace Setup

**Workspace:** ICE — Nomba Hackathon  
**Team Key:** `ICE`  
**Team ID:** `7b8e307b-5c79-4471-b8c1-30921c873672`  
**Project ID:** `7943eafe-1ede-4d6c-b73f-3df82b8f27a0`

#### Created via Linear GraphQL API:
- **1 Project:** "ICE — Nomba Hackathon Build"
- **5 Milestones:** Phase 1–5 (Foundation → Polish & Demo)
- **9 Labels:** backend, frontend, payments, async, phase-1 through phase-5
- **37 Issues** (ICE-29 to ICE-64, ICE-309) — with full descriptions including:
  - Goal, Files, Implementation code, Tests, Acceptance Criteria, PR info
  - Correctly formatted markdown (no escaping artifacts)
- **52 Dependency Relations** — blocking chains wired between all tasks

```

### 4. Day 1 Parallelism Design

A key design decision: **all 4 devs start Day 1 in parallel** (no one waits):

| Dev | Day 1 Task | Blocked By |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| Peter | P01 (Express scaffold) | Nothing |
| Marvelous | M01 (DB schema — prepares SQL, merges after P01) | P01 |
| Emmanuel | E01 (Redis + BullMQ) | Nothing |
| Samkiel | S01 (Next.js scaffold) | Nothing |

### 5. PRD Coverage Audit

Every endpoint from PRD sections 6.1–6.5 and 7.1–7.4 is covered. The original 24-task set was missing 5 PRD endpoints:
- `POST /v1/vendors/:id/customers` → now covered by P07
- `POST /v1/vendors/:id/customers/:cid/account` → now covered by P07
- `PUT /v1/vendors/:id/account` → now covered by P06
- `POST /v1/payments/:id/refund` → now covered by M07
- `GET /v1/transactions/:id` → now covered by E06

### 6. First Iteration Issues (Fixed)

The first version (24 tasks, ICE-5 to ICE-28) had:
- **6 formatting bugs** — template literal escaping produced `\`` and `\$` in code blocks
- **5 missing PRD endpoints** — customer creation, vendor update, misdirected refund, transaction detail
- **Day 1 bottleneck** — only Peter could start; everyone else was blocked by E01

All issues were fixed in the rebuilt 37-task version.

### 7. TypeScript Migration

All 37 tasks switched from JavaScript to TypeScript:
- 129 file extension changes (`.js` → `.ts`, `.jsx` → `.tsx`)
- 19 code block language hints (`js` → `ts`)
- P01 updated with `tsconfig.json` (strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) and `tsx` runner
- Verified with automated integrity check — 0 issues found

### 8. Definition of Done (DoD) & Engineering Standards

Extracted the Git Workflow, Coding Standards, and Definition of Done into a companion document: `ICE_ENGINEERING.md`.

Cleaned up the Linear tasks to replace the verbose 76-line DoD with a single reference link pointing to `ICE_ENGINEERING.md` (via `cleanup-dod.py`). This keeps the Linear tasks concise while enforcing the same rules.

**Review flow:** Self-review with DoD checklist → Open PR → Peter reviews and approves → Merge

### 9. P01 Tooling Additions

P01 was expanded to include setup for:
- **Prettier** — zero-config formatting (`.prettierrc` with singleQuote + trailingComma)
- **ESLint** — basic TypeScript linting
- **pino** — structured logger with `createLogger(serviceName)` factory pattern
- **vitest** — test runner (`npm test` / `npm run test:watch`)
- **tsconfig** — added `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` for financial code safety

| `create-linear-issues.mjs` | Original 24-issue creation script (superseded) |
| `rebuild-linear-issues.mjs` | Final 37-issue rebuild script with retry logic |
| `switch-to-typescript.mjs` | Migrated all 37 issues from JS to TypeScript |
| `add-dod.mjs` | Added initial DoD to P01 (superseded by cleanup) |
| `cleanup-dod.py` | Replaced inline DoD in tasks with reference to `ICE_ENGINEERING.md` |
| `update-p01-webhook.py` | Appended the webhook tunneling test to P01 |
| `ICE_PRD.md` | Updated PRD with v1.2 stack details and team assignments |

| `README.md` | Root repo readme containing quick links |
| `verify-migration.py` | Verification script for TS migration integrity |
| `generateRef.js` | Pre-existing file (not modified) |

### 10. Repository & GitHub
- Initialized local git repository.
- Created private GitHub repository: `https://github.com/femix300/ICE`
- Renamed default branch from `master` to `main`.
- Created `dev` branch as the active integration branch.
- Pushed root-level documentation files (`README.md`, `ICE_PRD.md`, `ICE_ENGINEERING.md`, `HANDOFF.md`).
- Sent repository invites to the rest of the team:
  - Marvelous (`MK-Bills`)
  - Emmanuel (`Qwertyemma`)
  - Samkiel (`samkiell`)
- Consolidated all handoff files into the `handoffs/` directory. Peter uses the main `HANDOFF.md`, while others use their respective personal files.

## Outstanding / Next Steps

1. **Invite teammates to Linear:**  
   Peter needs to invite Marvelous, Emmanuel, and Samkiel to the Linear workspace via **Settings → Members → Invite**. Once invited, their issues can be assigned to them.

2. **API Key:**  
   The Linear API key used (`lin_api_FEzO08T6B8exsBs618DoskFIChEsHqBNX9ITInxE`) is Peter's personal key. It's hardcoded in the scripts — **rotate it after setup is complete** or store it as an env variable.

3. **Start coding:**  
   Day 1 tasks (P01, M01, E01, S01) have no blocking dependencies. The team can begin immediately.

## 11. P01 Execution (Project Scaffold)

- **Scaffold Built**: Express app initialized with ESM + TypeScript setup (`tsx` runner).
- **Tooling**: Configured ESLint 9 (flat config), Prettier, and Vitest.
- **Middleware**: Wired up `helmet`, `cors`, `express.json`, and `express-rate-limit`.
- **Validation**: Strict Zod environment variable parsing (`config.ts`).
- **Logging & Responses**: Integrated `pino` for JSON structured logs and created strict response helpers (`ok`, `created`, `noContent`).
- **Error Handling**: Implemented typed global error handling without falling back to `any`.
- **Tests**: Added full integration test for `/healthz` and unit tests for config parsing and response helpers.
- **Git**: Committed and merged to the `dev` branch.
- **Status**: **COMPLETE**. Unblocks **M01** (Marvelous) and **P02** (Peter).

## Technical Notes

- **Language:** TypeScript (switched from JavaScript during this session). All 37 issues updated: 129 file extension changes (.js → .ts, .jsx → .tsx), 19 code block hints (```js → ```ts). P01 includes full tsconfig.json + tsx setup.
- **Dev Runner:** `tsx` (TypeScript Execute) — zero-config, fast. `npm run dev` uses `tsx watch src/server.ts`.
- **Type Patterns:** Use `z.infer<typeof schema>` to derive types from Zod schemas. Shared types in `src/types/index.ts`.
- **Linear API:** GraphQL endpoint at `https://api.linear.app/graphql`. Auth via `Authorization: <api_key>` header (no Bearer prefix).
- **Rate limiting:** Linear's API throttles at ~100 req/min. Scripts use 400–500ms delays with 3-attempt retry logic.
- **Dependency type:** All relations use `type: "blocks"` with `issueRelationCreate`. The issueId is the *blocked* issue, relatedIssueId is the *blocker*.
- **Issue numbering:** ICE-1 to ICE-4 are Linear onboarding issues (pre-existing). ICE-5 to ICE-28 were the first iteration (deleted). ICE-29 to ICE-64 are the current live issues.
- **Frontend framework:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS (PRD originally said React, team confirmed Next.js).
- **State ID:** TODO state is `0d3e4f4f-d6bb-4533-a908-adc0c9fac10d` (used for all new issues).

## 12. Trials & Tribulations (Lessons Learned)
To avoid repeating past mistakes, any future agents or team members must strictly observe the following:

### 12.1 Modifying Linear Issues
- **Do NOT use regex or `sed` to edit Linear descriptions programmatically**. The markdown formatting and API parsing are highly sensitive. We caused severe data corruption and duplication trying to edit descriptions on the fly.
- **The Golden Script**: If issues need to be purged and rebuilt, **only** use `rebuild-linear-issues.mjs` (Claude Code's original implementation) as the source of truth for the task data.

### 12.2 Linear API "Blocks" Relationships
- We discovered a critical logic flaw in how Linear interprets relationships: The GraphQL mutation `issueRelationCreate(issueId, relatedIssueId, type: "blocks")` means that `issueId` **BLOCKS** `relatedIssueId`.
- In the original script, it was passing the *task* as `issueId` and the *dependency* as `relatedIssueId`, essentially telling Linear that the task blocked its own dependency!
- **Fix Applied**: We ran `flip-deps.py` to reverse all 52 relationships. **P01** is now correctly the root blocker (blocked by 0 tasks, blocks 4 downstream tasks).

### 12.3 Definition of Done (DoD) Formatting
- Originally, we appended a massive 8-point checklist to the bottom of every task.
- **Decision**: It was far too long and redundant. We removed it and replaced it with a single concise line in all tasks pointing to the engineering guide.

### 12.4 M01 Database Schema Snippets
- For M01 (Database Schema), we confirmed that we did **not** inject raw `CREATE TABLE` SQL snippets into the issue description; it remains a simple bulleted list of 10 tables pointing to PRD section 10. Marvelous's agent will handle the actual SQL generation.

### 12.5 Branching & Pull Request Workflow
- **CRITICAL:** Do not push directly to the `dev` branch.
- For every task, a new branch MUST be created off `dev` using the correct conventional prefix (e.g., `feat/P01-project-scaffold`, `fix/login-bug`, `chore/deps`, `docs/update-readme`).
- Commits are pushed to this branch on the remote.
- A Pull Request must be opened targeting the `dev` branch.
- Execution stops until the Pull Request is reviewed, approved, and merged by the Team Lead (Peter).
- Eventually, the `dev` branch will be tested and merged into `main` for production.
### 12.6 Security Documentation Updates
- Updated `ICE_ENGINEERING.md` to include explicit Frontend Security (Section 2.11) and Dependency Security (Section 2.12) standards.
- Updated `ICE_PRD.md` Security Model table to include Frontend Security and Dependency Security rows.
- Expanded the Definition of Done (DoD) in `ICE_ENGINEERING.md` to include security checks for frontend and dependencies.

## 13. Session Transition: Preparing for P02 (Auth Middleware)

**Status at Handoff:**
- **P01 (Project Scaffold)** is complete and pushed to GitHub via PR #4 (`feat/P01-scaffold`).
- The Express app is fully configured with TypeScript, `pino`, `zod`, and `vitest`.
- We are now ready to begin **P02: Auth middleware — API key hashing, verification, tier scoping (ICE-102)**.

**Next steps for the incoming agent:**
1. Pull the latest `dev` branch to ensure P01's changes are present.
2. Checkout a new branch `feat/P02-auth-middleware` from `dev`.
3. Implement the auth middleware in `src/middleware/auth.ts`.
4. Ensure the implementation adheres strictly to the `ICE_ENGINEERING.md` DoD (e.g., use `crypto.timingSafeEqual`, no `any` types, etc).
5. Write unit tests for the auth middleware before opening the PR.
